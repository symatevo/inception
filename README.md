## Summary

The "Inception" project is designed to give students hands-on experience with Docker, a powerful containerization platform that allows for easy deployment, scaling, and management of applications. Through this project, students will learn how to create and manage Docker containers, build Docker images, and work with Dockerfiles.

## Skills to Learn

- Docker
- Containerization
- Dockerfiles
- Docker Images
- System Administration

## The "Inception" Project

### Description

The "Inception" project involves the following main tasks:

1. Setting up a personal virtual machine (VM) on your local system.
2. Installing and configuring Docker on the virtual machine.
3. Creating Docker containers by pulling and using existing Docker images.
4. Writing Dockerfiles to build custom Docker images.
5. Managing and running Docker containers on the virtual machine.
6. Understanding the basics of containerization and system administration with Docker.

The project will challenge students to virtualize and manage various applications or services using Docker. They will be required to build and run containers for different software, customize container configurations, and experiment with different Docker commands and options.

## Project Constraints

- Students must have access to a personal virtual machine to perform the Docker-related tasks.
- The project may involve running and testing various applications or services within Docker containers.
- Students should familiarize themselves with Docker concepts, commands, and Dockerfiles.
